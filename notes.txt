headText- big text (64px) - {44px}
conText- normal text (40px) - {20px}
loneText- mediumish sized text (32px) - 
sixText- smaller mediumish sized text (36px) - 
tinyText- smallest text size (24px) - {16px}

one way to make a button is using the <form> tag
like so;
<form>
            <input
              type="button"
              value="Deductions"
              onclick="window.location.href='#dedLink'"
            />
          </form>
